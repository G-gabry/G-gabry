# English-to-Arabic Translator - Machine Learning for Accurate Translationsng üè°üî•

## üìå Introduction
In this project, we develop an English-to-Arabic translation tool using transformer-based machine learning models. The goal is to provide an accurate and efficient system for translating English text into Arabic, handling the complexities of both languages. The system focuses on generating natural-sounding translations while maintaining the meaning of the original text.

We aim to enhance language understanding and improve the quality of machine translation, making it easier for users to communicate across language barriers.


## üîç Key Questions
-How can we achieve accurate and fluent translations between English and Arabic?
-How does the transformer architecture improve translation quality?
- are the challenges in translating complex sentences and structures between English and Arabic?
-How can we use machine learning to handle language-specific nuances and grammar rules?
-Can we optimize the model to handle various domains, such as formal and informal language?

# üéÆ Composite Shapes Game - Enhancing User Engagement with C++

## Introduction
The **Composite Shapes Game ** In this project, we developed a Composite Shapes Game using C++ that challenges players to manipulate and combine shapes to progress through levels. The game encourages problem-solving and strategic thinking by requiring players to use various shape transformations, such as rotation, flipping, and movement, to achieve goals.

The project focuses on implementing object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to create a modular, scalable, and maintainable codebase, while providing an engaging and interactive experience for users.



This project will guide you through essential steps in working with imbalanced datasets, including handling distribution issues, applying various sampling techniques, and evaluating classifier performance.

## Goals
-Design a scalable and modular game structure using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to ensure efficient code management and future updates.
-Implement interactive gameplay mechanics that challenge players to manipulate and combine various composite shapes, including features like rotation, flipping, and movement.
-Create a user-friendly interface that provides a seamless experience, making the game intuitive and easy to navigate for players of all ages.
-Optimize game performance, ensuring smooth handling of complex shapes and animations while maintaining responsiveness and fluidity.
-Enhance player engagement by introducing progressively challenging levels, dynamic scoring mechanisms, and visual feedback to keep the player motivated.
-Test and refine the game logic to ensure all features work as expected, offering a bug-free and enjoyable experience to the user.
